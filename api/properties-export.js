/**
 * DealMatch — Honeypot Trap
 * ===========================
 * File: api/properties-export.js
 *
 * Anti-Scraping Pillar 3 — Honeypot
 *
 * This endpoint is NEVER linked from the real DealMatch UI.
 * It exists purely to catch scrapers and bots who discover it
 * by crawling the codebase, sitemap, or API patterns.
 *
 * Any request here means:
 * - A bot found it through automated discovery
 * - A competitor is trying to bulk-export your listing data
 * - A bad actor is probing your API surface
 *
 * What happens:
 * 1. IP + UA + timestamp logged to console (visible in Vercel logs)
 * 2. 3-second artificial delay (tarpit — wastes scraper's time)
 * 3. Returns convincing but completely empty response
 * 4. Never returns real data — ever
 *
 * To activate: this file being present in /api/ is enough.
 * Vercel will automatically serve it at /api/properties-export
